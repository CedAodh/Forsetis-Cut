These are the maps of the various menus that have menu text baked into a tilemap.
Each word (two bytes, or 4 characters) represents a tile.

Some of these files may not be entirely accurate to how the tilemaps are in LM nowadays,
but what's important isn't the content of each word, but the highlighted regions.
This allows you to more easily find out each tilemap is organized.

You can edit the contents of the box to create and visualize your own tilemaps
(particularly useful for translations), and paste the result into the appropriate files
in text_menus/tilemaps and graphics.
