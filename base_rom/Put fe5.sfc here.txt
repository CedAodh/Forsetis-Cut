Your ROM must be an unheadered, unpatched, Japanese Fire Emblem - Thracia 776 ROM.
You will need the physical (V-ROM) version. The Nintendo Power (NP) version is untested as a base and thus discouraged.

No physical roms will be provided in this repository.
If you really struggle to extract the exact ROM from your legally-obtained cartridge of FE5...
I hear adding the magic number 27615 to one's google searches can prove fruitful.

Once acquired, you will need to expand your base ROM with Lunar Expand.
The correct setting is > 48 Mbit ExLoROM (6 MB) 2 < (80:8000 - FF:FFFF map)

From there, it is heavily recommended not to edit your base ROM with other tools.
Unless you are required by the limitations of the current build files.
(For example, you may need to use Min's FE5 Map Editor tool on the base ROM.)

All Nightmare modules I'm aware of have already been converted to individual files, mostly in tables.
Editing those is preferable to using Nightmare on the base ROM.
