These commands have a .byte in front of them when used:

NewLine: Use this command when you want to start text on a new line.
The game has no idea when it has reached the right end of the speech bubble,
so it's up to you to know when to add a "line break," as we like to call it.
When you want to do a line break can be a matter of preference/style.
I have a habit of doing line breaks right after the end of a sentence.

ScrollText: Pushes ALL text currently in the speech bubble past the top
so that it can no longer be seen.

EndText: You use this command when the conversation event is officially done,
and nowhere else. It clears out all portraits, text, and speech bubbles, so
you don't have to worry about doing those manually when the conversation is over.

Left_slot: Using this tells the game that every command you will be typing after
it will happen on the left side of the conversation. It also automatically makes
the speech bubble pop up for that side if it wasn't already opened.

Right_Slot: Same except it happens on the right side.

WaitForA: Pauses the conversation where it is, and it will not continue
until the game gets an A button input.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These commands have a .word in front of them when used:

LoadPortrait: Makes a portrait pop up. After this command, you will have to add
another command right under itthat tells the game which portrait you want to pull up.
This command also requires a .word in front of it. Most portraits are defined as
(name)_portrait. For example, leif_portrait, linoan_portrait, raydrik_portrait
Leif's angry portrait definition is leif_portrait2

ClearPortrait: Does exactly what it says. No follow-up command is required here.

RetractBox: Makes a speech bubble disappear in the middle of the conversation.
Typically used after ClearPortrait 

PlayMusic: Does exactly what it says. Followed by a .byte command and the value ($XX)
of the specific track that you want to play. I do not have that list of values on hand.
It's not always necessary, since if the conversation isn't all that dramatic and like
something to really focus in on, the map music currently playing will carry into the conversation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most importantly, text:

Has a .text command in front of it and two of these quotation mark pairs at the front and end
of EACH indivual line of text. "

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you mix up the first part of the command and do something like
.word NewLine or .byte LoadPortrait, you'll screw it up.

Now I'll try doing a simple example that incorportates all of the commands.
